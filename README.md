# Data-Processing-and-Black-Box-Meta-Learning

## Overview
This repository contains my coursework for Stanford's XCS330 course, specifically Problem Set 2, which explores meta-learning through the implementation and analysis of Memory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANN). The primary focus is on few-shot classification using the Omniglot dataset, covering both the data processing aspects and the application of meta-learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `src/`:
  - `submission/`: Contains all Python scripts for the MANN implementation.
    - `__init__.py`: Module initializer.
    - `load_data.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
    - `mann.py`: Contains the Memory-Augmented Neural Network implementation.
  - `mann_results_*.npy`: Numpy files storing results from various configurations and experiments.
- `submission.pdf`: Detailed analysis and results discussion.

## Installation and Setup
To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

   git clone https://github.com/TinaMoz/Data-Processing-and-Black-Box-Meta-Learning.git
   
## Data
This project uses the Omniglot dataset, which is not included in this repository. Follow instructions in src/submission/load_data.py to download and set up the dataset correctly.

## Results
Results from the experiments are stored in .npy files and discussed in detail in submission.pdf.

## Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome. Please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Stanford XCS330 course staff and my peers who provided insights and feedback on this project.
